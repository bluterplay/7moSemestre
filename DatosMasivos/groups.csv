Currently this meetup is mostly for people who have some knowledge of machine learning but not deep learning. If you are an expert in deep learning then you are most welcome to join but we may not have much to offer, unless you want to brush up your DL skills or are interested in guiding DL enthusiasts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to a great learning experience with all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Update (05/11): We have finished the Udacity course on Deep Learning and moving forward we have decided to focus on lectures as well as the ongoing research in the area of Deep Learning. So cater these, first half will focus on the learning side (as a part of which we will be covering the Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing course by Stanford next) and the second half of the meetup would focus on the exploration side (we will have guest speakers or paper presentations). &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

We are in the middle of the worst drought in over 500 years in this region, and it’s not going to get any easier, in fact, it could turn into a Zombieland if this dryspell keeps its record-setting pace.</p>
<p>It’s gonna take some good ol’ human ingenuity and collective engineering, plus a boatload of behavioral hacking and some creative open-innovation for us to make the situation any better.</p>
<p>We may not have very much potable drinking water out here, but we do have a lot of talented, creative, entrepreneurial, and engineering-minded hacktivists — and if we all combine our unique skills and talents together we can develop some innovative solutions.</p>
<p>The idea of this movement is to Hack the Drought. This is a hackathon combined with a project-based approach to providing real solutions to some of the most pressing problems facing water officials, farmers, and all of us. Hack the Drought meetups are being concurrently organized in major Western cities in order to rally the region’s best and brightest to approach the problem from new perspectives.</p>
<p>Water is the most fundamental human right we all share, and we need to take creative, collective, and proactive steps to work towards solutions instead of just sitting around pretending like it will all be okay. Let’s Hack the Drought and help the Western US avoid the potential chaos that will come with a prolonged and record-setting drought.</p>

These are all going to be targeted to experienced software engineers who just want to learn more about machine intelligence. In all of this, we're assuming that you probably know how to read software manuals, but the barrier to understanding state of the art machine learning is just a bit higher than is easy to pull off on evenings and weekends. So we'll focus on helping you to develop intuition and a good, solid understanding of the basics as well as enough software to help you keep going when you get home (or back to work). In other words, we'll help you decide what to do next.</p>
<p>In the process, we'd like to help people get to know each other.</p>
<p>(There's no monopoly here on actually doing the courses or trainings. If you think you'd like to offer ML/DS instruction, ping the organizer and we can schedule something.)</p>
<p>The world does not lack in free online courses and articles on ML and DS, of course. This works for some, not for all. And for many of us who work with these topics, it's easy to forget that it can be hard at first.</p>
<p>If anyone here wants to use this meetup to propose introductory courses to help people get up to speed, feel free to ping me and I'm happy for this group to serve as a vehicle. If you have ideas on how to make such courses better find their audiences, that's also a useful topic. Based on the profiles of those who have joined the meetup, we're perhaps a group that mostly understands ML and DS rather than a group at the beginning of the adventure.</p>",Jeff Abrahamson,54568782

<p>This group is for everyone- both Stacki users and beginners to Stacki- you don't need to have any prior experience!</p>
<p>Stacki is an open source CentOS/RHEL bare metal provisioning tool that can take your servers from bare hardware (or virtual hardware) to working Linux, ready to install applications. Stacki does this at scale, so deploying 1000+ servers is no more complex than deploying one. Once your servers are installed with Stacki, you can augment them with configuration tools like Puppet, Chef, Salt, CFEngine, Ansible, etc.&nbsp;</p>

We commonly have core sessions for beginners on EC2, S3 and RDS and we have three different types of MeetUps:</p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>Type 1: Sharing what we know</p>
<p>We do this for materials that we completely understand and want to share with others.&nbsp;<span>For example, Glen Jarvis have been using EC2 professionally for over 4 years. He has plenty of experience with EC2. &nbsp;Here is a sample video that shows how to get up and running with EC2 from scratch:</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmNgXQXkpWs"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmNgXQXkpWs</a></p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>Type 2. Learning by Teaching</p>
<p>There are often topics that we mostly understand but not polished enough to do as a ""Sharing what we know"" session. This is perfect for someone who wants to give a talk but doesn't yet understand the materials 100%. When one read/learns to present, the level of learning is much higher than if they were just reading for themselves.</p>
<p>For example, imagine that you you understood S3 fairly well and you knew the theory of how to make CloudFront make a static webpage. But, imagine you didn't quite know how to make it work, but you were really curious and it was a personal challenge. If you volunteered to give the next talk on how to set-up CloudFront and S3 to be a static webpage, it would be a great way to dig deep and share what you learned.</p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>3. Skunk-work Hack-a-thons&nbsp;</p>
<p>These MeetUps are typically a lot longer (most of the day instead of just an hour or so). They are for topics that are not known to the group. There are a LOT of Amazon Web Services after all -- and they keep growing. In these MeetUps we break into teams, try to absorb what we can from the docs and experimentation and then we have 'show-and-tell' for what we learned in the day wrap-up.</p>","Glen Jarvis, LLC Business Accnt",198162358

<p><b>Does The Hyperledger Project have the potential to become the engine behind most successful decentralized applications and organizations created in the next 25-50 years? Absolutely! </b></p>
<p>A much better question is how, and in what new ways, can we: </p>
<p>a) Build decentralized applications, organizations and APIs at 10x the speed at 1/10 the cost.</p>
<p>b) Build situational awareness in the local community.</p>
<p>I believe that the convergence of decentralized applications, decentralized organizations, artificial intelligence and IoT brings upon us the Great Displacement of the 21st century, where the majority of workforce will be left without “conventional” jobs, forced to learn new skills and professions. </p>
<p><b>Why? </b></p>
<p>Founders of this group believe that the Hyperledger Foundation will be the engine behind decentralization of the world, a massive economic change of the next 25-50 years. </p>
<p>So.... why don't we standardize and democratize the field with and around Hyperledger? </p>
<p><b>What? </b></p>
<p>We are a local micro community of those interested in advancing their knowledge of Hyperledger, its use cases and applications. </p>
<p><b>How? </b></p>
<p>Join our group for a regular dose of human interaction, conversations, smiles, food and drinks on all things Hyperledger: </p>
<p>• Use Cases</p>
<p>• Competitive analysis of Hyperledger startups (Distributed Apps from disruptive companies in specific vertical markets)</p>
<p>• How-To’s </p>
<p>• Interviews with individuals working at the edge of the Hyperledger project</p>
<p>• Reviews of tools, services and APIs offered by the Hyperledger ecosystem</p>
<p>• Best Practices in Application Architecture</p>
<p>• Do’s and Don’ts </p>
<p>• Application Templates</p>
<p>• Hackathons</p>
<p>• Security in the decentralized world - on the edge, on the node, in the cloud and in transit</p>
<p>• How others solve some of the hard problems that exist in the world using Hyperledger.</p>
<p><b>Join the movement. Let’s change the world. Because with Hyperledger we can.</b></p>

<p>Symfony is based on experience. It does not reinvent the wheel: it uses most of the best practices of web development and integrates some great third-party libraries.</p>
<p>Thousands of developers already trust symfony for their applications!</p>

<p>We are a real life, face-to-face technical community of &nbsp;computer &nbsp;programmers interested in Algorithm Design who get together at Hacker Dojo in Mountain View to talk, listen, and &nbsp;socialize discussing practical algorithms for solving problems all around us.</p>
<p>Our goal is to help coders in &nbsp;high level languages like Scala, Python, &nbsp;C++, or Java to acquire algorithm design skills as well as verbal exposition skills.</p>
<p>We are Alglorist Coders. We&nbsp;use <b>Math and Logic-based Globish</b> &nbsp;to communicate with one another. We welcome all accents and all unconventional sentence &nbsp;styles &nbsp;that convey the Algorithmic essence of the topic under discussion.</p>
<p><b>Alglore is folklore of Algorithm Designers</b> and that is a good way to get &nbsp;some of the best of the past of humankind. <b>Logical argument inherent in the folklore is really the focus of this group.</b></p>
<p><span>We model our argumentation style emulating&nbsp;W Richard Stark's 1990 book ""LISP, Lore, and Logic An Algebraic View of LISP Programming, Foundations, and Applications""</span></p>
<p><span>Another book 'Programming in Prolog' 1994 edition is useful to understand the elegant algorithm design that results because of Prolog perspective</span></p>
<p><span><b>What do we mean by Performant High level Code?</b></span></p>
<p>Performant code runs on current hardware to provide adequate fast response to end users. Our belief is that performant code can be written in mainstream high level languages like Ecmascript, Python, Java, Scala, Clojure, C++ etc. We can implement innovative ideas in software if we are aware of the <b>pitfalls of the past attempts</b> acknowledging all that is good in the current state of the art.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We conduct <b>low priced code-intensive tutorials and workshops&nbsp;in mainstream high level languages</b> to enhance implementation skills of algorithm designers and working programmers.</p>
<p><span>Please join us and help us build a community of highly motivated coders interested in continual learning!</span></p>

Our goal is to provide this space with an open heart and without pretension. You can bring your own projects to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions. Some people are experts, and some people are just getting started, but all of us are learning, so why not do it together?</p>

Other - you contribute to the success of the application in some way (DEVs are welcome) Our events provide you with a forum to learn and SHARE ideas with others who build and maintain the infrastructure. We're all trying to figure how to run a fast, efficient application/website delivery system, so this is a great place to share what works and what doesn't. <br>

<p><span>Statistics is not about formulas but is a way of thinking; it is a way of deriving information from data.  Life if full of correlations and trends with causes and consequences; Today's business climate is data driven and knowing how to deal with the data is essential.  Examples include survey and experimental design; collection, processing, and the analytical interpretation of the end results in the fields of biotech, banking, government, and environmental sciences.  </span></p>
<p><span>We believe that the entrepreneur-minded statistician is motivated to ask meaningful questions and delve into real problems in search of solutions.  Is that you?  If so, this is the group for you where you can brainstorm and network.  It is a group for any statistician or analyst who wants to apply that knowledge as an entrepreneur and for those who find the field of statistics as fascinating as we do. </span></p>",lily lin,6233979
